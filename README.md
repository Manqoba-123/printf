#### Compilation and installation
The code must be checked with betty: 
####


````bash
*$ betty _printf.c
````

The code must be compiled this way:
````bash
 *$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.c
 ````

 As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)

The main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h
